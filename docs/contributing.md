# Contributing to Katas
We'd love for you to be an Author! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting an issue / correction
- Submitting a revision
- Proposing new Katas

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host Kata definitions, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## All Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code or content, it must be demonstrated it builds correctly
3. If you've changed Katas, be sure to adhere to formatting rules
5. Issue that pull request!

### Submitting a Kata
The maintainers of the Kata Library adhere to the same pull request process as any other contributor. If you've authored a Kata or have made an update, please allow for 2 days for the maintainers to review and provide feedback to your pull request.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report issues using Github's [issues](https://github.com/gpsuscodewith/katas/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track everything in the Katas Library.

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report I wrote, and I think it's not a bad model. Here's [another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408), an app developer whom I greatly respect.

**Great Issues** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Reasons forhte change
  - Be specific!
- What you expected from the kata
- What your actually experience was

We *love* thorough reports :)

## Use the Kata Template
Every Kata is required to adhere to a specific formatting in markdown.

TBD.

## License
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its MIT License.
